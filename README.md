# Convolution Neural Network (CNN) Project

This repository is intended for future projects focused on implementing and experimenting with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification and other computer vision tasks.

## Project Goals
CNNs are powerful deep learning models commonly used for image-related tasks such as classification, object detection, and feature extraction. This repository will demonstrate how to build, train, and evaluate CNN models using popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras.

## Planned Features
- **Dataset Organization:** Proper folder structures for training and testing image data.
- **Model Architecture:** Implementation of CNN architectures with different layers for optimal performance.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Scripts to train and evaluate the CNN models.
- **Performance Visualization:** Tools for analyzing model accuracy and loss.

## Future Steps
1. **Project Setup:** Organize datasets and environment setup.
2. **Model Development:** Build and optimize CNN models.
3. **Evaluation and Improvements:** Fine-tune models and analyze results.
